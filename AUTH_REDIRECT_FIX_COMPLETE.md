# ðŸ”§ OAuth Login Redirect Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
After successful Google OAuth login via FastAPI backend, users were being redirected back to `/auth` instead of staying on `/test_dashboard`.

## Root Causes
1. **Timing Issue**: localStorage write operations might not complete before redirect
2. **Race Condition**: Auth page checks localStorage before callback completes storage
3. **Router Interference**: Next.js router.push() can cause redirect loops
4. **No Verification**: Callback didn't verify localStorage write success

## Solutions Applied

### 1. âœ… Updated Callback Page (`src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- âœ… Increased delay from 100ms to 300ms before redirect
- âœ… Added verification check for localStorage write success
- âœ… Changed `window.location.href` to `window.location.replace()` to prevent back button issues
- âœ… Better error handling with explicit error messages

**Why it works:**
- `window.location.replace()` doesn't add to browser history, preventing back button loops
- Longer delay ensures localStorage is fully written and synced
- Verification check prevents redirect if storage fails

### 2. âœ… Updated Auth Page (`src/app/auth/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- âœ… Added 200ms delay before checking authentication
- âœ… Added check to skip redirect if coming from callback page
- âœ… Wrapped in setTimeout with cleanup

**Why it works:**
- Delay prevents interference with callback redirect process
- Callback detection prevents premature redirects
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 3. âœ… Updated Test Dashboard (`src/app/test_dashboard/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- âœ… Added 100ms delay to ensure localStorage is read after write
- âœ… Changed `router.push()` to `window.location.replace()` for failed auth
- âœ… Added async/await for proper timing control

**Why it works:**
- Small delay ensures localStorage is fully synced before reading
- `window.location.replace()` prevents redirect loops
- Async/await ensures proper timing

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
// Then hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Step 2: Test Login Flow
1. Navigate to: https://advotac02.vercel.app/auth
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google OAuth
4. Should redirect to: https://advotac02.vercel.app/test_dashboard
5. âœ… Should stay on test_dashboard (not redirect back to auth)

### Step 3: Verify Authentication Persistence
1. Refresh the page: Should stay on test_dashboard
2. Close and reopen browser: Navigate to /auth, should auto-redirect to test_dashboard
3. Manually go to /test_dashboard: Should show dashboard without redirect

### Step 4: Console Verification
Check browser console for these logs:
```
âœ… [CALLBACK] Token received successfully
ðŸ’¾ [CALLBACK] Storing authToken in localStorage...
âœ… [CALLBACK] Verification - Token stored: true
ðŸš€ [CALLBACK] Authentication successful, redirecting to test_dashboard...
ðŸ”„ [DASHBOARD] Dashboard component mounted, checking authentication...
âœ… [DASHBOARD] Token found in localStorage: ...
```

## Expected Flow Diagram

```
User Clicks "Google Login"
         â†“
Redirect to FastAPI Backend
(https://fastapi-eight-zeta.vercel.app/auth/google)
         â†“
Google OAuth Process
         â†“
FastAPI Backend Receives Token
         â†“
FastAPI Redirects to Callback with Token
(https://advotac02.vercel.app/auth/callback?token=xxx&email=xxx&name=xxx)
         â†“
Callback Page Extracts Token
         â†“
Store in localStorage (300ms delay)
         â†“
Verify Storage Success
         â†“
window.location.replace('/test_dashboard')

Test Dashboard Loads (100ms delay)
         â†“
Check localStorage for Token
         â†“
âœ… Token Found â†’ Show Dashboard
```

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy to Vercel
```powershell
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd "e:\Project\Website- AI law\v7\New folder (2)\advotac"

# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## If Issue Persists

### Additional Debugging

1. **Check Browser Console** for any errors or unexpected redirects
2. **Check Network Tab** to see if API calls are failing
3. **Check Application Tab** â†’ Local Storage to verify token is stored

### Manual localStorage Test
```javascript
// In browser console on /test_dashboard:
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('authToken'));
console.log('User Data:', localStorage.getItem('userData'));
```

### Check FastAPI Backend
Verify FastAPI is returning correct callback URL:
```
https://advotac02.vercel.app/auth/callback?token=XXX&email=XXX&name=XXX&image=XXX
```

### Next Steps if Still Failing

1. **Check FastAPI Backend Code**
   - Verify callback URL format
   - Check if token is being generated correctly
   - Verify redirect URL construction

2. **Add More Logging**
   - Add console.log in every step
   - Check browser Network tab
   - Monitor localStorage changes in real-time

3. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Use cookies instead of localStorage (more reliable for SSR)
   - Implement NextAuth properly (use Next.js built-in auth)
   - Add session storage as backup

## Files Modified
- âœ… `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
- âœ… `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
- âœ… `src/app/test_dashboard/page.tsx`

## Summary
The fix addresses timing issues, race conditions, and browser history problems by:
1. Using proper delays to ensure localStorage sync
2. Using `window.location.replace()` instead of `router.push()`
3. Adding verification checks
4. Preventing redirect loops with callback detection

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and Ready for Testing
**Next Step**: Deploy and test on production (https://advotac02.vercel.app)
