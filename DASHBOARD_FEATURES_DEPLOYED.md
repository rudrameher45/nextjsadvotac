## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```typescript
const [question, setQuestion] = useState('');          // User's question
const [response, setResponse] = useState('');          // AI response
const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false); // Loading state
const [copySuccess, setCopySuccess] = useState(false);  // Copy feedback
```

### Key Functions:
1. **`handleGenerateResponse()`** - Generates AI response (simulated)
2. **`handleCopyToClipboard()`** - Copies text to clipboard
3. **`handleDownloadPDF()`** - Downloads as text/PDF
4. **`handleDownloadDocx()`** - Downloads as DOC/DOCX
5. **`handleSuggestedQuestion()`** - Auto-fills question

### Mock Response:
Currently returns a simulated legal response. Replace with actual API call:

// TODO: Replace with actual API
const response = await fetch('/api/legal-ai', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ question }),
});
```
