# Dashboard API Integration Summary

## ✅ Completed

Your dashboard at **https://advotac02.vercel.app/dashboard** is now integrated with FastAPI backend!

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Dashboard Updated (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Fetches user data from FastAPI: `https://fastapi-eight-zeta.vercel.app/api/user/profile`
- Uses Bearer token authentication from localStorage
- Displays: **Name, Email, Image** from API
- Shows subscription and credits information
- Error handling with fallback to cached data

### 2. API Call Details
```typescript
fetch('https://fastapi-eight-zeta.vercel.app/api/user/profile', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})
```

### 3. Expected API Response
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "image": "https://...",
  "plan_name": "Free Plan",
  "credits_remaining": 50,
  "credits_total": 50,
  "subscription_status": "active"
}
```

## 📋 FastAPI Backend Requirements

You need to implement this endpoint in your FastAPI backend:

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/user/profile`
**Auth:** Bearer token in Authorization header
**Response:** JSON with user data (name, email, image, plan, credits)

See `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete implementation details.

## 🚀 Deployment

✅ **Live Now:** https://advotac02.vercel.app/dashboard

## 🔄 Complete Flow

1. User signs in with Google → Gets token from FastAPI
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Dashboard loads → Fetches user data from FastAPI `/api/user/profile`
4. Displays: Name, Email, Image from API response
5. Shows subscription and credits info

## 📝 Files Changed

1. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to fetch from API
2. `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete integration guide
3. `FASTAPI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - OAuth integration guide

## ⚠️ Important

Make sure your FastAPI backend:
1. Has `/api/user/profile` endpoint implemented
2. Accepts Bearer token authentication
3. Returns user data (name, email, image)
4. Has CORS configured for `https://advotac02.vercel.app`

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to: https://advotac02.vercel.app/auth
2. Sign in with Google
3. You'll be redirected to dashboard
4. Dashboard will call FastAPI to fetch your profile data
5. Check browser DevTools → Network tab to see the API call
