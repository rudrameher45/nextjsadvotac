## 🧪 How to Use

### Step 1: Open Console
1. Go to **https://advotac02.vercel.app/auth**
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd+Option+J on Mac)
3. Click **Console** tab
4. Clear console (right-click → Clear)

### Step 2: Enable Log Preservation
1. Click the **gear icon** in console
2. Check ☑️ **"Preserve log"**
3. This keeps logs when pages change

### Step 3: Test Login
1. Click **"Continue with Google"**
2. Complete Google authentication
3. Watch console logs in real-time!

### Step 4: Review Flow
You'll see every step:
```
[AUTH] → OAuth click
↓
[CALLBACK] → Token received & stored
↓
[DASHBOARD] → Token verified & user data loaded
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Made Easy

### Problem: Login Loop
**What to check:**
```
✅ [AUTH] User already authenticated, token found: ...
🚀 [AUTH] Redirecting to test_dashboard...
```
If you see this but stay on `/auth`, check for navigation errors below these logs.

### Problem: Token Not Persisting
**What to check:**
```
✅ [CALLBACK] Verification - Token stored: true
```
Then:
```
❌ [DASHBOARD] authToken found: false
```
This means localStorage is being cleared.

### Problem: API Errors
**What to check:**
```
📡 [DASHBOARD] API Response status: 401
```
Check FastAPI backend - token is invalid.

### Problem: No Token from OAuth
**What to check:**
```
❌ [CALLBACK] No token received from OAuth provider
```
FastAPI isn't returning a token. Check FastAPI logs.

## 📈 Improvements Made

### Before:
- ❌ Silent failures
- ❌ Unknown redirect issues
- ❌ No visibility into flow
- ❌ Hard to debug

### After:
- ✅ Every step logged
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Full visibility
- ✅ Easy debugging
- ✅ Self-service troubleshooting

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Log Levels Used:
- `console.log()` - Normal flow
- `console.error()` - Errors
- `console.warn()` - (Reserved for future use)

### Data Sanitization:
- Tokens shown as truncated (first 20 chars + "...")
- Full token never logged (security)
- Personal data logged minimally

### Performance Impact:
- Minimal - logs only to console
- No network overhead
- No storage overhead
- Can be disabled in production later
