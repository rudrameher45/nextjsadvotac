# ✅ Dashboard Redirect Fix - Deployed

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully Deployed  
**Production URL:** https://advotac02.vercel.app

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Failure Fixed ✅
**Problem:** Empty file `src/app/assistant/analysis/[id]/page.tsx` caused TypeScript error:
```
Type error: File '/vercel/path0/src/app/assistant/analysis/[id]/page.tsx' is not a module.
```

**Solution:** Created a proper page component that redirects to `/assistant`

### 2. Dashboard Redirect After Login ✅
**Problem:** After successful login, users were being redirected to `/test_dashboard` instead of `/dashboard`

**Solution:** Updated all redirect paths from `/test_dashboard` to `/dashboard`

---

## 📝 Files Changed

### 1. `src/app/assistant/analysis/[id]/page.tsx` (NEW)
Created a proper page component with redirect logic:
```tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export default function AnalysisPage() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    router.push('/assistant');
  }, [router]);

  return <div>Redirecting...</div>;
}
```

### 2. `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
**Changed:** Redirect destination after authentication check
- **Before:** `window.location.href = '/test_dashboard';`
- **After:** `window.location.href = '/dashboard';`

### 3. `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
**Changed:** Redirect destination after OAuth callback
- **Before:** `window.location.href = '/test_dashboard';`
- **After:** `window.location.href = '/dashboard';`

## 🔄 Login Flow (Updated)

```
1. User visits /auth
   ↓
2. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
   ↓
3. Redirects to FastAPI OAuth:
   https://fastapi-eight-zeta.vercel.app/auth/google
   ↓
4. Google authentication
   ↓
5. Redirects to callback with token:
   /auth/callback?token=...&email=...&name=...
   ↓
6. Callback page stores token in localStorage
   ↓
7. ✅ Redirects to /dashboard (FIXED)
   ↓
8. Dashboard loads user data and displays interface
```
