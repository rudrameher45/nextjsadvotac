## ✨ What Was Built

### 1. Complete Dashboard (Matching Design)
- ✅ **Sidebar Navigation** with:
  - Overview
  - Assistant
  - Research  
  - Drafting
  - Workflow
  - History
  - Settings
  - Logout button
  
- ✅ **Main Dashboard Area** with feature cards:
  - Assistant (Chat, cite, act with guardrails)
  - Research (Statutes, case law, cross refs)
  - Drafting (Contracts, petitions, notices)
  - Workflow (Automate intake to filing)

- ✅ **User Profile Display** showing:
  - Name
  - Email
  - State
  - Role (I am a...)
  - Status

### 2. One-Time Profile Setup Flow
When a user logs in for the first time, they are shown a profile setup form where they provide:
- ✅ **State** (dropdown with all Indian states)
- ✅ **I am a** (dropdown with role options):
  - Advocate
  - Lawyer
  - Intern
  - Organisation

### 3. Database Schema
User data is stored in two tables (as per design):

**`users` table (from Google OAuth)**:
- `id` (primary key)
- `email` (from Google)
- `name` (from Google)
- `picture` (from Google)
- Other OAuth fields

**`user_info` table (profile details)**:
- `id` (primary key)
- `user_id` (foreign key → users.id)
- `full_name` (references users.name)
- `profile_pic` (references users.picture)
- `email` (references users.email)
- `state` (user selected)
- `iam_a` (user selected: advocate/lawyer/intern/organisation)
- `phone` (skipped for now as requested)
- `user_status` (PENDING/ACTIVE/SUSPENDED)
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
